Repository:
This repo contains the main back-end script for generating a player's HYPE value from the OPTA data stream.
The website is located at https://github.com/ArtemiiFrolov/Player-s-cam, run desktop.html - which displays the players resizing according to their hype. The front-end currently simulates values that would be recieved from the back-end script, integrating them is curently in progress.

The long-term vision of this project is to develop more advanced models to display the changing HYPE value of players - in an intuitive way for fans to better understand the game as it plays out.
